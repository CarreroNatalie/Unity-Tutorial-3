**CS/PSY Virtual Reality Final Project**
**Team 2 - Natalie Carrero, Allison Tang, Tina Meinhardt, Harry Sho K Aguinaldo**

# Project Overview
  Our VR Experience is designed to simulate a psychedelic trip for users who are curious and looking for a sensory-rich experience. The goal is to offer users a fully immersive simulation of the sensory distortion and visual hallucinations without taking real-world risks.

# How To Navigate The VR Experience:
  ## Main Menu
  The VR Experience begins with a Menu screen where User's can press "START" to begin the VR experience, "CONTROLS" to review user controls, and "EXIT" to close the program.
  ## Movement:
  User's will use the thumbstick to move around the environment. Head tracking will be used to manuever the in-game camera (look up/down/left/right). 
  ## Interaction:
  Various objects around the room environment will be interactable. User's can pick them up using **WHAT BUTTON?** button and throw them as well.
  ## Pause Menu
  By pressing "" **WHAT BUTTON T_T**, the user can access the pause menu where User's can return to the Main Menu (effectively ending the experience) or access the controls again.
    
# What To Expect
  The User will experience visual (warped colors, glowing, etc.) and auditory effects (distortion) throughout the experience. The experience is 5 minutes long and will take you back to the Main Menu once it is over.
